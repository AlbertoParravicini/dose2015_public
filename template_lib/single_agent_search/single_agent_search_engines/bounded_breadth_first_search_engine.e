	description: "[
				Bounded breadth first search engine. This is a generic implementation of breadth first search
				algorithm, to be applied to search problems. To use this engine, instantiate the class 
				providing search states, rules for search states, and a search problem involving the
				search states and rules.
				Bounded breadth first search performs an uninformed, exhaustive breadth-first search up to depth 
				maximum_depth.
